# Validation for SMV-007: WebSocket Chat Endpoint with Mock Service

This document records the successful implementation and validation of the `/ws/v1/chat` WebSocket endpoint.

## Key Concepts Validated

This task successfully validated two critical software development patterns:

1.  **WebSocket Communication:** An API endpoint was created to handle real-time, stateful connections for a chat application.
2.  **Service Mocking:** A mock `GeminiClient` was used in place of a real, external AI service. This allowed for fast, reliable, and cost-effective testing of the application's internal logic without external dependencies.

## Procedure

A self-contained bash script was executed to perform a full, end-to-end test of the chat feature. The script performed the following actions:

1.  **Project Setup:** Created a temporary FastAPI project with an SQLite database and all necessary dependencies, including the `websockets` library for the test client.
2.  **Database & Migration:** Created a `users` table in the SQLite database using an Alembic migration.
3.  **Mock Service:** Implemented a mock `GeminiClient` that returns a predictable, hardcoded string: `"[calm] 這是一個來自 Mock 服務的回應。"`
4.  **API Implementation:**
    *   Created the `/ws/v1/chat` WebSocket endpoint.
    *   Upon connection, the endpoint queries the database for the user's selected character based on the `x-user-id` header.
    *   When a message is received, it calls the **mock** `GeminiClient` to get a response.
    *   It parses the emotion tag and text from the mock response and sends it back to the client in a structured JSON format.
5.  **Test Data Seeding:** Inserted a test user (`test-user`) into the database, with their selected character set to `yuki`.
6.  **Validation:**
    *   Launched the FastAPI server.
    *   Used an inline Python script with the `websockets` library to connect to the endpoint as `test-user`.
    *   Sent a "Hello" message.
    *   Received the response from the server.
    *   Asserted that the response was of type `ai_response` and contained the exact emotion and text from the mock service.
7.  **Cleanup:** Shut down the server and removed all temporary files, including the SQLite database.

## Outcome

The validation script executed perfectly. The WebSocket client successfully connected, sent a message, and received the correctly formatted response from the mock service. This confirms that the entire internal logic of the chat endpoint—including database lookups, service calls, and response formatting—is working as expected.
