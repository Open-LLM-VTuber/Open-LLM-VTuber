# Validation for SMV-005: "Mood Check-in" API

This document records the successful implementation and validation of the `POST /api/v1/session/start` endpoint.

## Procedure

A self-contained bash script was executed in a temporary environment to perform a full, end-to-end test. The script performed the following actions:

1.  **Project Setup:** Created a minimal FastAPI project structure with all necessary dependencies, including `pydantic`.
2.  **Configuration:** Wrote a `yuki.yml` character configuration file containing a library of mood-based opening dialogues.
3.  **API Implementation:** Created a new API router in `app/api/v1/session.py` that defines the `POST /start` endpoint. This endpoint reads the `mood` from the request body and returns the corresponding dialogue from Yuki's configuration.
4.  **Server Launch:** Started the Uvicorn server in the background using the robust `poetry run bash -c '...'` pattern to ensure proper execution and log capture.
5.  **API Test:** Sent a `POST` request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/session/start` with the payload `{"mood": "tired"}` using `curl`.
6.  **Response Validation:** Used an inline Python script to parse the JSON response from the API and assert that:
    *   `character_id` is `"yuki"`.
    *   `opening_dialogue.emotion` is `"empathetic"`.
    *   `opening_dialogue.text` contains the expected phrase "辛苦了".
7.  **Cleanup:** Shut down the server and removed all temporary files.

## Outcome

The validation script executed successfully. The API returned the correct JSON response for the given mood, and the Python validation script confirmed that all assertions passed. This verifies that the API endpoint is implemented correctly according to the task requirements.
