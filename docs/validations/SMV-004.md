# Validation for SMV-004-REVISED: Character Config Loading

This document records the successful validation of the character configuration loading mechanism.

## Procedure

A self-contained bash script was executed in a temporary environment. The script performed the following steps:

1.  Created a minimal FastAPI project structure with Poetry inside a temporary directory (`temp_char_loader_test`).
2.  Wrote a sample character configuration file (`yuki.yml`).
3.  Wrote a `CharacterManager` Python module designed to load all `.yml` files from a specified configuration path upon application startup.
4.  Wrote a minimal `main.py` to launch the FastAPI application.
5.  Started the Uvicorn server in the background using a robust `poetry run bash -c '...'` command.
6.  Checked the server's log output to confirm the presence of the success message: `成功載入 1 個角色設定檔` (Successfully loaded 1 character config file).
7.  Shut down the server and cleaned up all temporary files.

## Outcome

The validation script ran successfully, and the expected log message was found. This confirms that the character loading mechanism, as designed, works correctly.
